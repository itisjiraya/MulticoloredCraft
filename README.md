# MulticoloredCraft

MulticoloredCraft is a plugin that adds prefixes to your server. The specific version of the plugin is 1.20.x.

# Installation:

1. Move the plugin to the "plugins" folder of your server.
2. Restart the server (a new folder should be created).

# Creating a Beautiful Prefix:

Personally, I used [this website](https://www.birdflop.com/resources/rgb/) to create a beautiful prefix. When installing the prefix, use the "&" or "ยง" symbol.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance. Happy crafting!
